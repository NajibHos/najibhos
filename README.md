# Hi, I'm Najib Hossain ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently exploring new technologies, upgrading my skills, and seeking opportunities to grow as a developer. My main focus is **front-end development** with React and Next.js, and Iâ€™m expanding into **full-stack development** to **contribute,** build scalable **SaaS applications.**
